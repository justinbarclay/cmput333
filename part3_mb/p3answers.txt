file size of plaintext: 80 bytes, 8 blocks 

*Comparison for enc mode*
file size of cipherecb.enc: 88 bytes, 8 blocks
i) The size of cipherecb.enc increases by 8 bytes as the key is use to encrypt a partial block, and that information is put into the resulting file (cipherecb.enc)

ii) The pattern repeats in the cipher text as it does in the plaintext because ecb encrypts independently encrypts each __ bit block of the plaintext. Thus the pattern will repeat exactly 

*Comparison for cbc mode*
file size of ciphercbc.enc: 88 bytes, 8 blocks 
i) The size of ciphercbc.enc increases

ii) No discernable pattern
