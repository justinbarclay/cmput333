*NOTE:* please contact us if you use lastpass, and we can share the passwords
with you to make life a little easier (because these are truly sadistic
passwords) without the use of a password manager
** Reasoning: 
- Passwords are randomly generated using LastPass (very reputable password
  service) to prevent dictionary attacks and ensure integrity of random
  generation
- We wanted to ensure that it was impossible to brute force a password
    + It takes 16.69 million trillion trillion trillion trillion trillion
    trillion trillion centuries to exhaustively search this password space
    (Assuming one hundred trillion guesses per second)
- The ease of use, and proven security benefits of using a password manager
  and randomly generated passwords makes the use of user created passwords
  inexcuseable
- If we were implimenting this assignment in the real world, these ports
  would be open to online brute force/dictionary attacks (excepting the use
  of something like Fail2Ban), so it is a neccessity to have an extremely
  secure password to prevent unauthorized access to the server(s).
